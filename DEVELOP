/* 1. Automated testing */

- Dependancy -
1. Selenium 
   This is a tool for automated testing web applications. It is included in /test/.
        
2. Sendmail
   If you want the report to inform anyone by email, this program should exist. 
   Otherwise, all information will be logged into /test/log. Please make sure this 
   directory is writable by apache.

- Setting up test bed -
The automated testing require special conditions:
1. OpenFISMA web directory(/public/) need to be installed to the root of the URL, 
   say http://testbed.openfisma.org/.  No trailing path appears.

2. /test/ under root directory have to be accessible from apache by setting up an
   alias on the same domain, or virtual host. http://testbed.openfisma.org/test/
   Under /conf/apache/, there is a sample config file (openfisma_test.conf) for apache.

3. access from the URL http://testbed.openfisma.org/test/index.html to manually run 
   the test suite.

4. Adding a cron job also helps, however an Xwindows is needed to run a web browser.
