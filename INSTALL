Smarty is a template engine for PHP. More specifically, it facilitates a
managable way to separate application logic and content from its presentation.

The source inherently come along with a Smarty distribute under /vendor/smarty.
You can always enjoy the relax free from installation of Smarty. However there is
chance if you want to use your own Smarty distribute, please follow instructions below:

     $ wget http://smarty.php.net/do_download.php?download_file=Smarty-2.6.18.tar.gz
  b: Unzip the downloaded file to a directory you own
     $ tar -zxvf smarty-2.6.18.tar.gz
  c: Make a directory to hold Smarty
     $ mkdir /usr/local/lib/php/Smarty
  d: Copy the library files to your new directory
     $ cp -r Smarty/libs/* /usr/local/lib/php/Smarty
  e: Add /usr/local/lib/php/Smarty to 'include_path' variable in php.ini  
  f: Delete /vendor/smarty directory under the root of the source code.

/* Step Five: Setup OpenFISMA */

     $ tar -zxvf ovms-1.x.tar.gz
     $ cp -r ovms-1.x/* /var/www/html
  c: Configure the smarty director in the config file
     $ vi /var/www/html/public/config.inc.php
  d: Run the web installation script
     > Browse to http://<host_address>/install/index.php
     > Follow the wizard through the installation steps
