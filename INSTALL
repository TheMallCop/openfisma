    OpenFISMA INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
============================================================================

1.0 Software Pre-Requisites

You must have the following software installed before proceeding with
the installation of OpenFISMA.

* Apache 2 or greater
* PHP 5.2.0 or greator
* MySQL 5 or greator

2.0 OpenFISMA Setup

Create a directory for OpenFISMA
 $ mkdir /opt/openfisma

Change into the new directory
 $cd /opt/openfisma

Download the latest copy of OpenFISMA
 $ wget http://downloads.sourceforge.net/openfisma/openfisma-x.x.x.x.zip

Unzip the files you just downloaded
 $ unzip openfisma-x.x.x.zip

You should now have a directory structure which looks like the following
  > apps - folder that holds OpenFISMA application 
  > public - public folder or document root for webserver
  > vendor - third party modules used by OpenFISMA

Next you will need to tell Apache where the public directory of OpenFISMA
resides. Apache configuration is different on almost all flavors of unix
but the configuration file below should only require minimal changes to 
get you up and running. You will need to customize the server name to 
the appropriate name and validate that the path for the error logs is 
correct. 
  
    # Virtual Host for Reyosoft Development and Testing
    <VirtualHost *:80>
      Servername www.openfisma.org
      DocumentRoot "/opt/openfisma/public"
      ErrorLog /var/log/apache2/reyosoft-error.log
      CustomLog /var/log/apache2/reyosoft-access.log common
      <Directory "/opt/openfisma/public">
          AllowOverride None
          Options FollowSymLinks
          Allow from all
      </Directory>
    </VirtualHost>
  
The following files need to be writeable for the installation script 
to run. 
	
	/public/temp
    /log
    /public/evidence
    /apps/config/install.conf

To accomplish this we will run the following commands.

   $ chmod 777 /opt/openfisma/public/temp
   $ chmod 777 /opt/openfisma/log
   $ chmod 777 /opt/openfisma/public/evidence
   $ chmod 777 /opt/openfisma/apps/config/install.conf
  
If all has gone well, you will be able to run the installation script
from your browser at http://<server_name>/. Follow the wizard through
the installation steps. During the installation the wizard creates
the /opt/openfisma/apps/config/install.conf file. If the install.conf
contents are deleted, the wizard will run through the installation process
again.  

3.0 Security Hardening

After the installation you will want to remove the ability to run the
installation wizard and protect the install.conf file. This can be done
by deleting the InstallController.php file and changing the permissions
for the install.conf file.

  $ rm /opt/openfisma/apps/controller/InstallController.php
  $ chmod 755 /opt/openfisma/apps/config/install.conf
