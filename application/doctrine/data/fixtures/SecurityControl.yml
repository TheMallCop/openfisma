            This control is intended to produce the policy and procedures that are required for the effective
            implementation of selected security controls and control enhancements in the access control family. The
            policy and procedures are consistent with applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies,
            regulations, standards, and guidance. Existing organizational policies and procedures may make the need for 
            additional specific policies and procedures unnecessary. The access control policy can be included as part 
            of the general information security policy for the organization. Access control procedures can be developed 
            for the security program in general and for a particular information system, when required. The 
            organizational risk management strategy is a key factor in the development of the access control policy.

            The identification of authorized users of the information system and the specification of access privileges 
            is consistent with the requirements in other security controls in the security plan. Users requiring 
            administrative privileges on information system accounts receive additional scrutiny by organizational 
            officials responsible for approving such accounts and privileged access. Related controls: AC-3, AC-4, AC-5,
