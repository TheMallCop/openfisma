        family: Access Control
        control: The information system enforces assigned authorizations for controlling access to the system in accordance with applicable policy.
        guidance: Access control policies (e.g., identity-based policies, role-based policies, rule-based policies) and associated access enforcement mechanisms (e.g., access control lists, access control matrices, cryptography) are employed by organizations to control access between users (or processes acting on behalf of users) and objects (e.g., devices, files, records, processes, programs, domains) in the information system. In addition to controlling access at the information system level, access enforcement mechanisms are employed at the application level, when necessary, to provide increased information security for the organization. Consideration is given to the implementation of a controlled, audited, and manual override of automated mechanisms in the event of emergencies or other serious events. If encryption of stored information is employed as an access enforcement mechanism, the cryptography used is FIPS 140-2 (as amended) compliant. Related security control: SC-13.

        family: Access Control
        control: The information system enforces assigned authorizations for controlling the flow of information within the system and between interconnected systems in accordance with applicable policy.
        guidance: Information flow control regulates where information is allowed to travel within an information system and between information systems (as opposed to who is allowed to access the information) and without explicit regard to subsequent accesses to that information. A few, of many, generalized examples of possible restrictions that are better expressed as flow control than access control are: keeping export controlled information from being transmitted in the clear to the Internet, blocking outside traffic that claims to be from within the organization, and not passing any web requests to the Internet that are not from the internal web proxy. Information flow control policies and enforcement mechanisms are commonly employed by organizations to control the flow of information between designated sources and destinations (e.g., networks, individuals, devices) within information systems and between interconnected systems. Flow control is based on the characteristics of the information and/or the information path. Specific examples of flow control enforcement can be found in boundary protection devices (e.g., proxies, gateways, guards, encrypted tunnels, firewalls, and routers) that employ rule sets or establish configuration settings that restrict information system services or provide a packet filtering capability. Related security control: SC-7.
        controlLevel: MODERATE
        enhancements: (1)\nThe information system implements information flow control enforcement using explicit labels on information, source, and destination objects as a basis for flow control decisions.\nEnhancement Supplemental Guidance: Information flow control enforcement using explicit labels is used, for example, to control the release of certain types of information.\n(2)\nThe information system implements information flow control enforcement using protected processing domains (e.g., domain type-enforcement) as a basis for flow control decisions.\n(3)\nThe information system implements information flow control enforcement using dynamic security policy mechanisms as a basis for flow control decisions.

        control: The information system enforces separation of duties through assigned access authorizations.
        guidance: The organization establishes appropriate divisions of responsibility and separates duties as needed to eliminate conflicts of interest in the responsibilities and duties of individuals. There is access control software on the information system that prevents users from having all of the necessary authority or information access to perform fraudulent activity without collusion. Examples of separation of duties include: (i) mission functions and distinct information system support functions are divided among different individuals/roles; (ii) different individuals perform information system support functions (e.g., system management, systems programming, quality assurance/testing, configuration management, and network security); and (iii) security personnel who administer access control functions do not administer audit functions.

Selecting the right level of abstraction for audit record generation is a critical aspect of an audit capability and can facilitate the identification of root causes to problems. Additionally, the security audit function is coordinated with the network health and status monitoring function to enhance the mutual support between the two functions by the selection of information to be recorded by each function. The checklists and configuration guides at http://csrc.nist.gov/pcig/cig.html provide recommended lists of auditable events. The organization defines auditable events that are adequate to support after-the-fact investigations of security incidents. NIST Special Publication 800-92 provides guidance on computer security log management.

        control: The organization conducts an assessment of the security controls in the information system [Assignment: organization-defined frequency, at least annually] to determine the extent to which the controls are implemented correctly, operating as intended, and producing the desired outcome with respect to meeting the security requirements for the system.
        guidance: This control is intended to support the FISMA requirement that the management, operational, and technical controls in each information system contained in the inventory of major information systems be assessed with a frequency depending on risk, but no less than annually. The FISMA requirement for (at least) annual security control assessments should not be interpreted by organizations as adding additional assessment requirements to those requirements already in place in the security certification and accreditation process. To satisfy the annual FISMA assessment requirement, organizations can draw upon the security control assessment results from any of the following sources, including but not limited to: (i) security certifications conducted as part of an information system accreditation or reaccreditation process (see CA-4); (ii) continuous monitoring activities (see CA-7); or (iii) testing and evaluation of the information system as part of the ongoing system development life cycle process (provided that the testing and evaluation results are current and relevant to the determination of security control effectiveness). Existing security assessment results are reused to the extent that they are still valid and are supplemented with additional assessments as needed. Reuse of assessment information is critical in achieving a broad-based, cost-effective, and fully integrated security program capable of producing the needed evidence to determine the actual security status of the information system.   OMB does not require an annual assessment of all security controls employed in an organizational information system. In accordance with OMB policy, organizations must annually assess a subset of the security controls based on: (i) the FIPS 199 security categorization of the information system; (ii) the specific security controls selected and employed by the organization to protect the information system; and (iii) the level of assurance (or confidence) that the organization must have in determining the effectiveness of the security controls in the information system. It is expected that the organization will assess all of the security controls in the information system during the three-year accreditation cycle. The organization can use the current year's assessment results obtained during security certification to meet the annual FISMA assessment requirement (see CA-4). NIST Special Publication 800-53A provides guidance on security control assessments to include reuse of existing assessment results. Related security controls: CA-4, CA-6, CA-7, SA-11.

        guidance: A security certification is conducted by the organization in support of the OMB Circular A-130, Appendix III requirement for accrediting the information system. The security certification is a key factor in all security accreditation (i.e., authorization) decisions and is integrated into and spans the system development life cycle. The organization assesses all security controls in an information system during the initial security accreditation. Subsequent to the initial accreditation and in accordance with OMB policy, the organization assesses a subset of the controls annually during continuous monitoring (see CA-7). The organization can use the current year's assessment results obtained during security certification to meet the annual FISMA assessment requirement (see CA-2). NIST Special Publication 800-53A provides guidance on security control assessments. NIST Special Publication 800-37 provides guidance on security certification and accreditation.

        controlLevel: LOW
        enhancements: (1)\nThe organization employs an independent certification agent or certification team to conduct an assessment of the security controls in the information system.\nEnhancement Supplemental Guidance: An independent certification agent or certification team is any individual or group capable of conducting an impartial assessment of an organizational information system. Impartiality implies that the assessors are free from any perceived or actual conflicts of interest with respect to the developmental, operational, and/or management chain of command associated with the information system or to the determination of security control effectiveness. Independent security certification services can be obtained from other elements within the organization or can be contracted to a public or private sector entity outside of the organization. Contracted certification services are considered independent if the information system owner is not directly involved in the contracting process or cannot unduly influence the independence of the certification agent or certification team conducting the assessment of the security controls in the information system. The authorizing official decides on the required level of certifier independence based on the criticality and sensitivity of the information system and the ultimate risk to organizational operations and organizational assets, and to individuals. The authorizing official determines if the level of certifier independence is sufficient to provide confidence that the assessment results produced are sound and can be used to make a credible, risk-based decision. In special situations, for example when the organization that owns the information system is small or the organizational structure requires that the assessment of the security controls be accomplished by individuals that are in the developmental, operational, and/or management chain of the system owner or authorizing official, independence in the certification process can be achieved by ensuring the assessment results are carefully reviewed and analyzed by an independent team of experts to validate the completeness, consistency, and veracity of the results. The authorizing official should consult with the Office of the Inspector General, the senior agency information security officer, and the chief information officer to fully discuss the implications of any decisions on certifier independence in the types of special circumstances described above.

The plan of action and milestones updates are based on the findings from security control assessments, security impact analyses, and continuous monitoring activities. OMB FISMA reporting guidance contains instructions regarding organizational plans of action and milestones.

        control: The organization authorizes (i.e., accredits) the information system for processing before operations and updates the authorization [Assignment: organization-defined frequency, at least every three years] or when there is a significant change to the system. A senior organizational official signs and approves the security accreditation.
        guidance: OMB Circular A-130, Appendix III, establishes policy for security accreditations of federal information systems. The organization assesses the security controls employed within the information system before and in support of the security accreditation. Security assessments conducted in support of security accreditations are called security certifications. The security accreditation of an information system is not a static process. Through the employment of a comprehensive continuous monitoring process (the fourth and final phase of the certification and accreditation process), the critical information contained in the accreditation package (i.e., the system security plan, the security assessment report, and the plan of action and milestones) is updated on an ongoing basis providing the authorizing official and the information system owner with an up-to-date status of the security state of the information system. To reduce the administrative burden of the three-year reaccreditation process, the authorizing official uses the results of the ongoing continuous monitoring process to the maximum extent possible as the basis for rendering a reaccreditation decision.

        guidance: Continuous monitoring activities include configuration management and control of information system components, security impact analyses of changes to the system, ongoing assessment of security controls, and status reporting. The organization assesses all security controls in an information system during the initial security accreditation. Subsequent to the initial accreditation and in accordance with OMB policy, the organization assesses a subset of the controls annually during continuous monitoring. The selection of an appropriate subset of security controls is based on: (i) the FIPS 199 security categorization of the information system; (ii) the specific security controls selected and employed by the organization to protect the information system; and (iii) the level of assurance (or grounds for confidence) that the organization must have in determining the effectiveness of the security controls in the information system. The organization establishes the selection criteria and subsequently selects a subset of the security controls employed within the information system for assessment. The organization also establishes the schedule for control monitoring to ensure adequate coverage is achieved. Those security controls that are volatile or critical to protecting the information system are assessed at least annually. All other controls are assessed at least once during the information system's three-year accreditation cycle. The organization can use the current year's assessment results obtained during continuous monitoring to meet the annual FISMA assessment requirement (see CA-2).\nThis control is closely related to and mutually supportive of the activities required in monitoring configuration changes to the information system. An effective continuous monitoring program results in ongoing updates to the information system security plan, the security assessment report, and the plan of action and milestones'the three principle documents in the security accreditation package. A rigorous and well executed continuous monitoring process significantly reduces the level of effort required for the reaccreditation of the information system. NIST Special Publication 800-37 provides guidance on the continuous monitoring process. NIST Special Publication 800-53A provides guidance on the assessment of security controls.

Additionally, it is sometimes convenient to provide multiple services from a single component of an information system, but doing so increases risk over limiting the services provided by any one component. Where feasible, the organization limits component functionality to a single function per device (e.g., email server or web server, not both). The functions and services provided by information systems, or individual components of information systems, are carefully reviewed to determine which functions and services are candidates for elimination (e.g., Voice Over Internet Protocol, Instant Messaging, File Transfer Protocol, Hyper Text Transfer Protocol, file sharing).
        controlLevel: MODERATE

        family: Identification and Authentication
        control: The information system uniquely identifies and authenticates users (or processes acting on behalf of users).
        guidance: Users are uniquely identified and authenticated for all accesses other than those accesses explicitly identified and documented by the organization in accordance security control AC-14. Authentication of user identities is accomplished through the use of passwords, tokens, biometrics, or in the case of multifactor authentication, some combination thereof. NIST Special Publication 800-63 provides guidance on remote electronic authentication including strength of authentication mechanisms. For purposes of this control, the guidance provided in Special Publication 800-63 is applied to both local and remote access to information systems. Remote access is any access to an organizational information system by a user (or an information system) communicating through an external, non-organization-controlled network (e.g., the Internet). Local access is any access to an organizational information system by a user (or an information system) communicating through an internal organization-controlled network (e.g., local area network) or directly to a device without the use of a network. Unless a more stringent control enhancement is specified, authentication for both local and remote information system access is NIST Special Publication 800-63 level 1 compliant. FIPS 201 and Special Publications 800-73, 800-76, and 800-78 specify a personal identity verification (PIV) credential for use in the unique identification and authentication of federal employees and contractors. In addition to identifying and authenticating users at the information system level (i.e., at system logon), identification and authentication mechanisms are employed at the application level, when necessary, to provide increased information security for the organization.\nIn accordance with OMB policy and E-Authentication E-Government initiative, authentication of public users accessing federal information systems may also be required to protect nonpublic or privacy-related information. The e-authentication risk assessment conducted in accordance with OMB Memorandum 04-04 is used in determining the NIST Special Publication 800-63 compliance requirements for such accesses with regard to the IA-2 control and its enhancements. Scalability, practicality, and security issues are simultaneously considered in balancing the need to ensure ease of use for public access to such information and information systems with the need to protect organizational operations, organizational assets, and individuals.

        guidance: Information system authenticators include, for example, tokens, PKI certificates, biometrics, passwords, and key cards. Users take reasonable measures to safeguard authenticators including maintaining possession of their individual authenticators, not loaning or sharing authenticators with others, and reporting lost or compromised authenticators immediately. For password-based authentication, the information system: (i) protects passwords from unauthorized disclosure and modification when stored and transmitted; (ii) prohibits passwords from being displayed when entered; (iii) enforces password minimum and maximum lifetime restrictions; and (iv) prohibits password reuse for a specified number of generations. For PKI-based authentication, the information system: (i) validates certificates by constructing a certification path to an accepted trust anchor; (ii) establishes user control of the corresponding private key; and (iii) maps the authenticated identity to the user account. In accordance with OMB policy and related E-authentication initiatives, authentication of public users accessing federal information systems (and associated authenticator management) may also be required to protect nonpublic or privacy-related information. FIPS 201 and Special Publications 800-73, 800-76, and 800-78 specify a personal identity verification (PIV) credential for use in the unique identification and authentication of federal employees and contractors.

        guidance: Information system media includes both digital media (e.g., diskettes, magnetic tapes, external/removable hard drives, flash/thumb drives, compact disks, digital video disks) and non-digital media (e.g., paper, microfilm). This control also applies to portable and mobile computing and communications devices with information storage capability (e.g., notebook computers, personal digital assistants, cellular telephones).  An organizational assessment of risk guides the selection of media and associated information contained on that media requiring restricted access. Organizations document in policy and procedures, the media requiring restricted access, individuals authorized to access the media, and the specific measures taken to restrict access. The rigor with which this control is applied is commensurate with the FIPS 199 security categorization of the information contained on the media. For example, fewer protection measures are needed for media containing information determined by the organization to be in the public domain, to be publicly releasable, or to have limited or no adverse impact on the organization or individuals if accessed by other than authorized personnel. In these situations, it is assumed that the physical access controls where the media resides provide adequate protection.

        control: The organization physically controls and securely stores information system media within controlled areas.
        guidance: Information system media includes both digital media (e.g., diskettes, magnetic tapes, external/removable hard drives, flash/thumb drives, compact disks, digital video disks) and non-digital media (e.g., paper, microfilm). A controlled area is any area or space for which the organization has confidence that the physical and procedural protections provided are sufficient to meet the requirements established for protecting the information and/or information system. This control applies to portable and mobile computing and communications devices with information storage capability (e.g., notebook computers, personal digital assistants, cellular telephones). Telephone systems are also considered information systems and may have the capability to store information on internal media (e.g., on voicemail systems). Since telephone systems do not have, in most cases, the identification, authentication, and access control mechanisms typically employed in other information systems, organizational personnel exercise extreme caution in the types of information stored on telephone voicemail systems.\nAn organizational assessment of risk guides the selection of media and associated information contained on that media requiring physical protection. Organizations document in policy and procedures, the media requiring physical protection and the specific measures taken to afford such protection.

The organization protects information system media identified by the organization until the media are destroyed or sanitized using approved equipment, techniques, and procedures.\nAs part of a defense-in-depth protection strategy, the organization considers routinely encrypting information at rest on selected secondary storage devices. FIPS 199 security categorization guides the selection of appropriate candidates for secondary storage encryption. The organization implements effective cryptographic key management in support of secondary storage encryption and provides protections to maintain the availability of the information in the event of the loss of cryptographic keys by users.

        control: The organization: (i) requires that providers of external information system services employ adequate security controls in accordance with applicable laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, guidance, and established service-level agreements; and (ii) monitors security control compliance.
        guidance: An external information system service is a service that is implemented outside of the accreditation boundary of the organizational information system (i.e., a service that is used by, but not a part of, the organizational information system). Relationships with external service providers are established in a variety of ways, for example, through joint ventures, business partnerships, outsourcing arrangements (i.e., through contracts, interagency agreements, lines of business arrangements), licensing agreements, and/or supply chain exchanges. Ultimately, the responsibility for adequately mitigating risks to the organization's operations and assets, and to individuals, arising from the use of external information system services remains with the authorizing official. Authorizing officials must require that an appropriate chain of trust be established with external service providers when dealing with the many issues associated with information system security. For services external to the organization, a chain of trust requires that the organization establish and retain a level of confidence that each participating service provider in the potentially complex consumer-provider relationship provides adequate protection for the services rendered to the organization. Where a sufficient level of trust cannot be established in the external services and/or service providers, the organization employs compensating security controls or accepts the greater degree of risk to its operations and assets, or to individuals. The external information system services documentation includes government, service provider, and end user security roles and responsibilities, and any service-level agreements. Service-level agreements define the expectations of performance for each required security control, describe measurable outcomes, and identify remedies and response requirements for any identified instance of non-compliance. NIST Special Publication 800-35 provides guidance on information technology security services. NIST Special Publication 800-64 provides guidance on the security considerations in the system development life cycle.

        guidance: A variety of technologies exist to limit, or in some cases, eliminate the effects of denial of service attacks. For example, boundary protection devices can filter certain types of packets to protect devices on an organization's internal network from being directly affected by denial of service attacks. Information systems that are publicly accessible can be protected by employing increased capacity and bandwidth combined with service redundancy.

        subclass: Boundary Protection 
        family: System and Communications Protection
        control: The information system monitors and controls communications at the external boundary of the information system and at key internal boundaries within the system.
        guidance: Any connections to the Internet, or other external networks or information systems, occur through managed interfaces consisting of appropriate boundary protection devices (e.g., proxies, gateways, routers, firewalls, guards, encrypted tunnels) arranged in an effective architecture (e.g., routers protecting firewalls and application gateways residing on a protected subnetwork commonly referred to as a demilitarized zone or DMZ). Information system boundary protections at any designated alternate processing sites provide the same levels of protection as that of the primary site.        As part of a defense-in-depth protection strategy, the organization considers partitioning higher-impact information systems into separate physical domains (or environments) and applying the concepts of managed interfaces described above to restrict or prohibit network access in accordance with an organizational assessment of risk. FIPS 199 security categorization guides the selection of appropriate candidates for domain partitioning.        The organization carefully considers the intrinsically shared nature of commercial telecommunications services in the implementation of security controls associated with the use of such services. Commercial telecommunications services are commonly based on network components and consolidated management systems shared by all attached commercial customers, and may include third party provided access lines and other service elements. Consequently, such interconnecting transmission services may represent sources of increased risk despite contract security provisions. Therefore, when this situation occurs, the organization either implements appropriate compensating security controls or explicitly accepts the additional risk. NIST Special Publication 800-77 provides guidance on virtual private networks. Related security controls: MP-4, RA-2.

        guidance: A domain name system (DNS) server is an example of an information system that provides name/address resolution service. To eliminate single points of failure and to enhance redundancy, there are typically at least two authoritative domain name system (DNS) servers, one configured as primary and the other as secondary. Additionally, the two servers are commonly located in two different network subnets and geographically separated (i.e., not located in the same physical facility). If organizational information technology resources are divided into those resources belonging to internal networks and those resources belonging to external networks, authoritative DNS servers with two roles (internal and external) are established. The DNS server with the internal role provides name/address resolution information pertaining to both internal and external information technology resources while the DNS server with the external role only provides name/address resolution information pertaining to external information technology resources.
