view scripts are found in application/views/scripts/; the view script for 
the default controller and action is in 
application/views/scripts/index/index.phtml.

When determining the view script name and path, the views/scripts/ directory 
will be used as the base path, with a directories named after the individual 
controllers providing a hierarchy of view scripts.

By default, the ViewRenderer action helper is enabled. What this means is 
that by simply defining an action method and a corresponding view script, 
you will immediately get content rendered. By default, Zend_View is used 
as the View layer in the MVC. The ViewRenderer does some magic, and uses 
the controller name (e.g., index) and the current action name (e.g., index) 
to determine what template to pull. By default, templates end in the .phtml 
extension, so this means that, in the above example, the template 
index/index.phtml will be rendered. Additionally, the ViewRenderer 
automatically assumes that the directory views at the same level as the 
controller directory will be the base view directory, and that the actual 
view scripts will be in the views/scripts/ subdirectory. Thus, the template 
rendered will be found in application/views/scripts/index/index.phtml.
