                 OpenFISMA is an open source application designed to reduce the complexity and automate the regulatory requirements of the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) and the National Institute of Science and Technology (NIST) Risk Management Framework (RMF). While many security managers are eager to demonstrate their best practices for incident response, patch management, and configuration management, they are overwhelmed with the reporting and documentation requirements of FISMA.
