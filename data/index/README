This directory contains Zend_Search_Lucene search indexes for all object types. Each object 
type stores its indexes in separate subdirectories.

If an index is corrupted, you can fix that by re-building the index. For example, to rebuild 
a corrupted Asset index:

    $ cd /opt/openfisma/scripts/bin
    $ sudo -u www-data php rebuild-index.php -m Asset

This directory is not used if the search provider is Solr, and it will be empty (except for 
this README file).
