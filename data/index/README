This directory contains Zend_Search_Lucene search indexes for all object types. Each object type stores its indexes in
separate subdirectories.

If an index is corrupted, you can fix that by deleting the entire directory that it's in and then re-building the index.
For example, to remove a corrupted Asset index:

    sudo rm -fr openfisma/data/index/Asset
    sudo -u apache php openfisma/scripts/bin/optimize-indexes.php

This directory is not used if the search provider is Solr, and it will be empty (except for this README file).
