# RPM Build Scripts

This directory contains all files related to OpenFISMA RPM builds.
You should have a general understanding about [RPMs][1] and how they 
are created. See the [packaging guidelines][2] for openSUSE or a similar 
document of another supported packaging system such as dpkg. 

## Prerequisites

Please review the [internal documentation][3] on using the OpenSUSE build service.
This documentation goes over how to get access to the build service and
general operating procedures for making changes.
