# OpenFISMA Cron Configuration
#
# OpenFISMA runs the background-tasks.php file every minute which in turn
# dispatches all of the other tasks OpenFISMA must needs to handle in a task
# fashion such as sending email and updating search indexes. Output will
# be logged to /usr/share/openfisma/data/logs/background-tasks.log or you
# can grep the system messages log for cron for information as well.

# Run background tasks for openfisma (once every minute)
