Q: How to install these test?
A: If you want to do this test, we suggest you backup you database at first. This test program will emtry the database.
   And then please follow the step.
   1. Copy ../conf/apache/conf.d/openfisma_test.conf file to your apache configration and according to your condition, modify parms in it. Make sure that you can access your site by root url. eg:http://localhost:8366/
   2. Download test database bag to local, decompress to ../testdb/. eg: ../testdb/*.sql 
   3. Open the brower and go to http://localhost:8366/test/index.html . Make sure you can see test page.
   Click the Hyperlink "Click here to run default test suite." to start it.

Q: How to add a new test case?
A: 1. Write the new test case through Selenium IDE, see http://wiki.openqa.org/display/SIDE/Recording+a+Test
   2. Upload it to fit sub directory in cases/ovms/ with a fit name.
   3. Update TestSuite.html, add a new line like <tr><td><a href="./cases/ovms/new_test.html">new test</a></td></tr> before </tbody> tag.
   4. Run test with url http://somehost/test/index.html

Q: What if I need a prepared test data
A: 1. A test case 'DataPrepare.html' is avaliable to do the routine work to recover backup data.
   2. Put the test case before any ones that utilizing these data.


Q: How to get the test result?
A: There are two ways. 
     First, if you have a sendmail configuration in you PHP.ini, it will auto send a email to you (modify the email address in postResults.php).
     Second, if you don't have a sendmail configuration with your PHP.ini, it will just log the test result under directory 'log' as a html file, so please make sure this directory is writable. 
    
Enjoy it!
:)
