Q: How to add a new test case?
A:	1. Write the new test case through Selenium IDE, see http://wiki.openqa.org/display/SIDE/Recording+a+Test
	2. Upload it to fit sub directory in cases/ovms/ with a fit name.
	3. Update TestSuite.html, add a new line like <tr><td><a href="./cases/ovms/new_test.html">new test</a></td></tr> before </tbody> tag.
	4. Run test with url http://somehost/test/index.html

Q: How to get the test result?
A: There are two ways. First, if you have a sendmail configuration in you PHP.ini, it will auto send a email to you (modify the address in postResults.php).
   Second, if you don't have a sendmail configuration with your PHP.ini, it will just log the test result under directory 'log' as a html file, so please make sure this directory is writable.
